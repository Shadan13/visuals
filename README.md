# Shadan // Visuals

A curated photography portfolio designed with a "Digital Museum" aesthetic. This project focuses on minimalism, typography, and negative space to give each image the weight of a physical exhibit.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
The interface mimics a high-end gallery space:
- **Isolation:** Vertical spacing allows each piece to be viewed without distraction.
- **Typography:** *Playfair Display* (Serif) is used for titles to contrast with the *Poppins* (Sans-Serif) technical data.
- **Darkroom Theme:** A specialized dark color palette distinct from the main portfolio.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Core:** Semantic HTML5, CSS3
- **Animation:** CSS Keyframes for smooth entry.
- **Performance:** Hardware-accelerated rendering for glitch-free high-res image scrolling.
